# Medical_Diagnosis_Prediction_Project

##Overview

This is the code for Medical_Diagnosis_Prediction.  The code uses the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) machine learning library to train a [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) and three others on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and BMI) labeled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Obesity and TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AND HYPOCHROMIA. Then we can predict the diagnosis of someone given a novel set of body metrics. This is only a
